# 🤖 JARVIS - Voice-Activated Virtual Assistant

> A personal desktop assistant built using Python that responds to your voice commands — inspired by sci-fi, engineered with real-world AI.

## 🧠 Overview

**JARVIS** is a lightweight virtual assistant designed to perform basic desktop tasks through speech recognition. The assistant listens for an activation keyword ("Jarvis") and then executes voice commands, making your system smarter and hands-free.

This project reflects my early practical exploration into **Artificial Intelligence**, **Natural Language Processing**, and **human-computer interaction**.

## 🚀 Features

- 🎙️ **Voice Activation**  
  - Say “Jarvis” to activate the assistant.
  
- 🌐 **Open Popular Websites**  
  - Supports commands like:
    - "Open Google"
    - "Open YouTube"
    - "Open LinkedIn"
    - and more!

- 🎵 **Local Music Playback**  
  - Comes with a built-in music player for 4 preloaded songs.
  - Just say: `"Play song 1"` (or 2, 3, 4)

- 🧪 **Expandable Framework**  
  - Modular design allows for easy feature expansion (e.g., reminders, weather updates, or file system integration).

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **Language**: Python  
- **Libraries**: 
  - `speech_recognition`
  - `pyttsx3` (text-to-speech)
  - `os`, `webbrowser`
  - `playsound` (for music playback)

## ⚙️ How to Use

1. Clone the repo and install required libraries:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
2.  Launch the script:
bash-
python jarvis.py

3. Wait for the assistant to initialize and say "Jarvis".

4. Start giving voice commands like:

"Open YouTube"

"Play song 2"

"Open Google"

📌 Project Status
✅ MVP Complete 
🧱 Currently at prototype stage 
🧠 Scope for future upgrades (e.g., chat-based interface, NLP command understanding, calendar integration)
